Task: Add an additional media type for audio. Currently the Editor does not support pure audio clips.

User Interactions:
 - Users can add audio from the filesystem to the editor
 - The audio can also be dragged on the timeline and additionally:
 - Users can trim and extend the visible duration of an audio clips
 - Audio is not visually rendered in the viewport, it just plays audio on playback
 - Add additional actions for audio only to the actions area:
  * Fade In (with a drawer to set the fade in seconds)
  * Fade Out (with a drawer to set the fade out seconds)
  * Speed (with a drawer)

Data Requirements: 
 - Make sure to integrate it properly into the store structure
 - The actions should be non destructive, users should be able to reset them at any time
 - The actions are always only applied to that one clip and nothing else

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
