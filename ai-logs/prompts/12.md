Task: Add a robust drag and drop for clips via dnd-kit.

User Interactions:
- Add a slight delay before it registers as a drag (dnd kit has an integration for this)
- Allow users to move clips across tracks. Make sure to add a threshold for Y dragging to activate.
- Inside one track, clips should not be allowed to overlap, ever. If users are cutting them (the buttons on the sides), then it should always stop at collision with another clip. If users are dragging the clip, then on drop it should always place them to the nearest free spot, but never overlap. But during drag, just let them freely drag it.
- The actively dragged item should become slightly larger, like 1.03 scale
- If a drag moves out of the viewport (or approaches the end), autoscroll (either horizontal or vertical). DND-Kit has an example for this too.

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
