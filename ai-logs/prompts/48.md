Task: Add proper video composition settings and apply them to the viewport renderer.

Requirements:
 - On the top left, where the "home" button currently is, replace that with a "Film" icon that opens a drawer with settings for video composition
 
 - Users can set the aspect ratio of the video, give them a free input (x:y) and also below that a dropdown to quickly preselect from common formats for video, film, social media, etc.

 - Allow users to set the base FPS of the video

 - Allow them to set the background of the canvas for rendering, give them some preset values but also a general color picker. Make sure the preset values use professional and modern colors.

 - Show the cutout of the video in the center of the canvas. The full cutout must always be fully visible, there is no zooming on the canvas. Make it always fit.

 - Anything outside the cutout is black background.

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
