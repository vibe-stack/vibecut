Task: Add a proper export feature to the video editor.

Requirements: 
 - on the top right is a share button, change that to a "export" label button

 - On clicking export open a drawer to let users select some final settings for export, such as file format, bitrate, etc.

 - it takes the the cutout from the composition on the canvas and export settings and renders the whole video once and exports it via mediabunny

- The canvas itself may render in resolutions below the target resolution. You may have to adjust the dpr or use any other ways threejs allows to do that

- Make sure to only use the cutout part of the canvas

- Make sure to include all audio in the tracks
 

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
