Task: Add an additional media type for images. Currently the Editor only supports videos.

User Interactions:
 - Users can add images from the filesystem to the editor
 - The images can also be dragged on the timeline and additionally:
 - Users can trim and extend the visible duration of an image
 - Images are also rotatable/scaleable in the canvas
 - Add additional actions for images only to the actions area:
  * Filters (will contain a predefined library of filters to choose from)
  * Adjust (Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Sharpen, Highlights, Shadows, Temperature, Hue, Vignette)

Data Requirements: 
 - Make sure to integrate it properly into the store structure
 - The filters and adjustments should be non destructive, users should be able to reset, change, remove them at any time
 - The filters and adjustments are always only applied to that one image clip and nothing else

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
