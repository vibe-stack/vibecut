There are mulitple problems still with the playback:
- Video rendering is still broken. It is playing them extremely fast and a 12s video is looped many times in the first 3 seconds already.
- There is a red flashing frame every few frames on video textures

Sidequests:
- If i click anywhere outside an element, deselect the element, but make sure to include the drag handles for cutting them as inside the element
- The dragging to cut an element is absolutely broken. A tiny movement (a few px) already cuts a 10s video to like 0.5 secs in total
