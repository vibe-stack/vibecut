Task: Redesign the video editor to be optimized for mobile, heavily inspired by mobile video editors.

Layout:
- Page Height is fully used (dvh), no scrolling whatsoever, use overflow behaviors for that
- The preview area takes up about 40% of the screen height from the top
- Below the preview area is the controls area, it contains:
 * Play / Pause
 * Jump to Start / End (double chevron)
 * Current Time / Max Time (xs)
 * Playback Speed select
- Below the control area is the tracks area:
 * Shows the timeline rule and playhead
 * Displays all tracks and clips
- Below that is a general, context dependant, "Modifiers & Actions" Area:
 - If nothing is selected, it shows general actions:
  * Add video
  *
