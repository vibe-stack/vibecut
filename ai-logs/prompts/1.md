Task: Redesign the video editor to be optimized for mobile, heavily inspired by mobile video editors.

Layout:
- Page Height is fully used (dvh), no scrolling whatsoever, use overflow behaviors for that
- On the Top is a slim black bar for home / export (export on the right side)
- The preview area takes up about 40% of the screen height from the top
- Below the preview area is the controls area, it contains:
 * Play / Pause
 * Jump to Start / End (double chevron)
 * Current Time / Max Time (xs)
 * Playback Speed select
- Below the control area is the tracks area:
 * Shows the timeline rule and playhead
 * Displays all tracks and clips
- Below that is a general, context dependant, "Modifiers & Actions" Area:
 - If nothing is selected, it shows general actions:
  * Add video
  * new track
 - If a track (just the track, not a single clip inside a track) is selected:
  * Toggle visibility
  * Mute/Unmute
  * Change Volume
  * Remove Track
 - If a video clip is selected:
  * Duplicate
  * Remove
  * Set Opacity
  * Toggle Visibility
  * Mute/Unmute
- All items in the actions area are either directly buttons that change their icons when toggled or they open up a drawer (use vaul for drawers) for more settings.

Design:
 - Change the overall design as you build it to be darker, no blue tinted gray pls. Black as the base color, use no borders, rounded floating design with background blurs instead.
 

 Notes:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI. Avoid too many colors, NO PURPLE.
