# Polishing the Track Area experience

Task: The Track Area mostly works okay, but it's lacking a lot of good UX. Your task is to implement robust and easy to use improvements.

Changes:
 - Remove the background from the track button in timeline-track
 - Remove the difference in background color from that piece above the timeline track buttons and left of the timeline ruler. It should have the same background as the ruler
 - Make the playhead red and center the circle on the top. It is off to the left
 - On mobile, I can't scroll left/right or up/down in the tracks area, at all
 - When duplicating a clip, it is placing every duplicating after the one currently selected. This leads to stacked clips if i duplicate the same multiple times. Rules:
  * Add it at the end of the current clip that is duplicated
  * If there is overlap with another clip on duplication, add it to the end of the clip that is
   overlapping
  * Repeat this process until you find a free spot
  * At the end duplication, smooth scroll that new clip into view and select it
 - There is currently a "nothing selected"-Contextual Action menu on the bottom. This should never be the case: Either the first track is selected, or any other track, or a clip. If "nothing" is selected, it defaults always to selecting the first track. This is also true if any track/clip is deleted.

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
