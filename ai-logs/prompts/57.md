Task: Fix the video editor exporter.

Problems:
 - The videos have a specific aspect ratio, which creates a cutout zone in the canvas
 - The Exporter correctly only takes that zone for export, but the resulting video itself is incorrect
 - I think this is due to the resolution setting in the exporter. Instead of hard-setting the resolution to e.g. 1920x1080, it should have a slider [720p, 1080p, 2k, 4k] etc. and use that as base resolution but keep the aspect ratio correct.
 - Make the bitrate also a slider

 - Fix the export!

 - The toast for the exporter is not really visible, i only see a thin 1px line of it, not the full toast. I assume it is because it is a child of the top bar

 Use base-ui for the slider, it includes things like steps and tracks, etc.

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
