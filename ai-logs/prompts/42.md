# Clip splits

Task: Implement clip splitting.

Notes:
- Duplicate the original clip
- Trim both clips to exactly the playheads position

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
