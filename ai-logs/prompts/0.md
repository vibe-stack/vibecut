Task: Build a mobile video editor. Ignore any specific desktop style optimizations

User Interactions:
 - Users see the preview of the rendered video in the preview area
 - The preview area takes up about the top half of the screen
 - It is rendered by react-three-fiber
 - Below the preview area is the controls area
 - For now, the controls area just shows play/pause
 - Below the controls area is the tracks area
 - It shows on the top the time markers, and the playhead in red
 - It has two track categories:
  1. General Media (Images, Video, Text)
  2. Audio
 - General Media Tracks consist of elements
 - An element holds the underlying data (video data, image, or text)
 - An element has a duration (start:finish) which in the case of a video element is startframe:lastframe (visible), for images and text it is 0:frames (how many frames it is visible)
 - Elements have a rendering pipeline which can consist of multiple modifiers (effects, postprocessing, filters, etc.)
 
 - Audio Tracks, well, hold audio elements and are displayed separately from general media tracks. They also hold information about start:finish (the element may start at 30 seconds of an audio file)
 
 - On the bottom is a modifiers & actions area
 - It is context aware and displays different actions & controls depending on the selection:
  * If an element of a track is selected, it shows actions for that track: e.g. of a video: split, volume, transitions, effects, delete, speed, duplicate, replace, filters
  * For audio: Split, volume, fade, delete
  * If nothing is selected it shows different actions to add things: Audio, Text, Video, Image

State Management:
 - Use valtio for state management
 - Hold all information of all elements, tracks, effects, postprocesses, everything related to the video itself in one valtio store
 - Everything related to the editor ui can be in other stores, idc

Notes:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI. Avoid too many colors, NO PURPLE.
