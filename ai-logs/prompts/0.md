Task: Build a mobile video editor. Ignore any specific desktop style optimizations

User Interactions:
 - Users see the preview of the rendered video in the preview area
 - The preview area takes up about the top half of the screen
 - It is rendered by react-three-fiber
 - Below the preview area is the controls area
 - For now, the controls area just shows play/pause
 - Below the controls area is the tracks area
 - It shows on the top the time markers, and the playhead in red
 - It has two track categories:
  1. General Media (Images, Video, Text)
  2. Audio
 - General Media Tracks consist of elements
 - An element holds the underlying data (video data, image, or text)
 - An element has a duration (start:finish) which in the case of a video element is startframe:lastframe (visible), for images and text it is 0:frames (how many frames it is visible)
 - Elements have a rendering pipeline which can consist of multiple modifiers (effects, postprocessing, filters, etc.)
 
 - Audio Tracks, well, hold audio elements and are displayed separately from general media tracks. They also hold information about start:finish (the element may start at 30 seconds of an audio file)
 
 - On the bottom is a modifiers & actions area
 - It is context aware and displays different actions & controls depending on the selection:
  * If an element of a track is selected, it shows actions for that track: e.g. of a video: split, volume, transitions, effects, delete, speed, duplicate, replace, filters
  * For audio: Split, volume, fade, delete
  * If nothing is selected it shows different actions to add things: Audio, Text, Video, Image

State Management:
 - Use valtio for state management
 - Hold all information of all elements, tracks, effects, postprocesses, everything related to the video itself in one valtio store
 - Everything related to the editor ui can be in other stores, idc

Notes:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI. Avoid too many colors, NO PURPLE.

Progress update: I scaffolded the editor feature with Valtio store, hooks, and UI components (Preview with react-three-fiber, Controls, Timeline with playhead and tracks, Actions bar), and wired the Home route to render it. Next, I'll run a quick typecheck and then update the README with usage notes.

Completed (9/9) *README quickstart update*

I’m moving ahead to implement the mobile-first editor UI with Valtio and react-three-fiber, wire it up in the Home route, and validate it builds end-to-end.

## actions taken

- Created a fully colocated editor feature with state, hooks, components, and utils:
  - editor.store.ts — Single Valtio store for the video project (timeline, tracks, elements, selection, playback).
  - usePlayback.ts — Advances currentFrame using requestAnimationFrame when playing.
  - time.ts — Formatting and layout helpers for frames and pixels.
  - EditorScreen.tsx — Main mobile layout: Preview (top ~50vh), Controls, Tracks, Actions footer.
  - Preview.tsx — react-three-fiber Canvas with a tiny scene indicating time; gated to client-only.
  - Controls.tsx — Play/Pause button wired to Valtio.
  - Timeline.tsx — Time ruler with seconds, red playhead, separate Media and Audio sections with elements laid out by time; selection support.
  - ActionsBar.tsx — Context-aware actions based on selection; simple stubbed buttons; delete wired.
  - index.ts — Barrel exports for components.
- Switched the Home route to render the editor:
  - home.tsx now imports and returns EditorScreen.
- Updated README with project-specific quickstart and feature notes.

## files changed

- Added: editor.store.ts — Valtio store types and actions.
- Added: usePlayback.ts — Playback loop hook.
- Added: time.ts — framesToTimecode, framesToPx helpers.
- Added: EditorScreen.tsx — Composes the UI regions.
- Added: Preview.tsx — r3f canvas with client-only guard.
- Added: Controls.tsx — Play/Pause control.
- Added: Timeline.tsx — Ruler, playhead, tracks/elements.
- Added: ActionsBar.tsx — Context actions/add area.
- Added: index.ts — Barrel export.
- Updated: home.tsx — Render EditorScreen.
- Updated: README.md — New overview, features, quickstart, structure.

## how to run

- I verified typecheck and build locally via your scripts.

Optional commands you can run:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
Then open the printed URL; Home route will show the editor.

## what you can do now

- Tap Play to see the time progress. The preview bar animates and the red playhead moves.
- Tap on any element in the tracks to select it; see actions change in the footer.
- Tap Delete in the footer to remove the selected element.

## design notes

- Mobile-first dark UI with muted cyan/emerald accents (no purple).
- Small, modular files; features are colocated under app/editor/*.
- All project-related state lives in one Valtio store as requested; UI state can be added separately later.

## quality gates

- Build: PASS (react-router build succeeded).
- Typecheck: PASS (react-router typegen && tsc ran without errors).
- Quick smoke: Canvas is client-guarded; home route renders EditorScreen.

Requirements coverage:
- Preview (react-three-fiber, top half): Done.
- Controls area (play/pause): Done.
- Tracks with time markers, red playhead, two categories: Done.
- Elements with start:end durations and selection: Done.
- Context-aware modifiers & actions area: Done (stubs wired for delete).
- Valtio global store for all video-related info: Done.
- Colocation and modularity: Done.
- Dark, calming, minimalistic, rounded UI, no purple: Done.

## next steps (optional)

- Implement real media loading and rendering in the Preview (images/video/text).
- Add pinch/zoom and horizontal scroll for the timeline; draggable playhead.
- Add element drag/resize and snapping to time markers.
- Hook up actions (split, transitions, fade, speed, filters) with proper mutators.
- Persist projects and support import/export.

Made changes.

alightinastorm: Continue with real media loading and rendering in the preview.

Sidequest: Change the r3f renderer to use webgpu

Great—I'll add real media rendering into the Preview and attempt a WebGPU renderer with a safe fallback to WebGL.

## plan
- Render actual timeline media (text, images, videos) at the current frame in the Preview with a new MediaLayer.
- Add a cautious WebGPU sidequest: try to switch the renderer to WebGPU at runtime when available, but gracefully fall back to WebGL so nothing breaks.

## actions taken

### 1) Real media in the Preview
- Added a new component `MediaLayer` that renders visible media elements from the Valtio store at the current frame:
  - Text: rendered via drei `Text`.
  - Image: rendered via drei `Image`.
  - Video: rendered via drei `useVideoTexture`; seeks the video to the right timestamp based on the element start, in/out, speed, and project fps. It pauses the HTMLVideoElement each frame to show exact frames.
- Integrated `MediaLayer` into the `Preview` scene.

New file:
- MediaLayer.tsx

Key details:
- Visibility check uses element start/end frames.
- Video timeline sync computes source time via:
  - sourceFrame = element.data.in + (currentFrame - element.start) * speed
  - video.currentTime = sourceFrame / fps
- All media are fit into a 16:9-ish area using an orthographic camera.

### 2) WebGPU sidequest with fallback
- Kept the `Canvas` straightforward (orthographic, dpr) for reliability.
- Added a `WebGPUBridge` component that runs client-side and attempts to swap the renderer to WebGPU at runtime:
  - Checks for `navigator.gpu`.
  - Dynamically imports Three’s WebGPU renderer using multiple known paths.
  - Calls `renderer.init()` when present.
  - Swaps the r3f renderer's core methods to the WebGPU renderer. If anything fails, we keep WebGL.
- Added ambient module declarations to satisfy TypeScript for the WebGPU renderer import paths.

New files:
- WebGPUBridge.tsx
- webgpu.d.ts

Updated files:
- Preview.tsx to:
  - Use `MediaLayer`.
  - Insert `<WebGPUBridge />` so it attempts WebGPU at runtime.

## how it behaves
- Preview shows actual text and image elements at the current timeline position.
- Video frames are displayed by seeking the hidden HTMLVideoElement; audio is muted and not played (display only).
- WebGPU attempt is silent and non-breaking:
  - If WebGPU is supported and the module exists in your version of three, it swaps in; otherwise, WebGL continues as usual.

## try it
- Start the dev server and open the app. Tap Play and watch:
  - The playhead moves in the tracks area.
  - The preview updates to display media elements when they are visible in time.
  - If on a device supporting WebGPU (and with a three version exposing the renderer), the renderer may switch; otherwise it stays on WebGL.

## notes and next steps
- Media source paths: I used the sample element data you already seeded in the store (favicon.ico for image). For videos, provide a valid `src` in the store to see it render frames.
- Performance tips: Video frame-accurate seeking can be expensive; caching or a frame server could improve smoothness later.
- If you want dragging/timing edits, we can add dnd-kit on the timeline and element resize handles next.
- If you prefer a stricter WebGPU integration (fully initialized at Canvas creation), we can adjust the Canvas gl creation path—this version minimizes risk by keeping a fallback.

If you want, I can also wire some quick controls to add Image/Video/Text elements via the footer actions so you can test with your own files.

Made changes.

alightinastorm: I did the webgpu integration myself, yours was wrong.

Continue with the footer actions to let me add image/video, text not needed for now.

Completed (3/3) *Add footer actions to import media*

Nice—since you’ve got WebGPU covered, I focused on adding footer actions to import image and video files and place them on the timeline at the current playhead.

## what’s implemented

- Footer “Add to timeline” section now has:
  - Image: Opens a file picker (image/*), creates a blob URL, inserts an image element starting at the current frame with a default 3s duration, and selects it.
  - Video: Opens a file picker (video/*), creates a blob URL, reads video metadata to get duration, converts to frames, creates a video element from current frame to current+duration, and selects it.
- Clean-up: When deleting an element that used a blob URL, it revokes the URL to avoid leaks.
- Store helpers:
  - `addImageFromSrc(src)`, `addVideoFromSrc(src, seconds)`
  - Both add to the first General Media track (creating one if needed), at the current playhead.
  - `deleteSelected()` revokes blob: URLs when applicable.

Key files:
- ActionsBar.tsx — wired image/video import via FilePicker.
- FilePicker.tsx — hidden input + rounded button UI.
- editor.store.ts — add* actions and safe URL revocation on delete.
- MediaLayer.tsx — already renders image/video/text visible at the playhead.

## how to use
- In the editor, make sure nothing is selected to see “Add to timeline.”
- Tap Image or Video:
  - Choose a file from your device.
  - The new element appears on the tracks at the red playhead and is selected.
  - The Preview displays it when it’s in range.

## notes and next steps
- Duration for images is a fixed 3s (tweak in `addImageFromSrc`).
- Video duration is derived from metadata (fallback to 1s if metadata fails).
- We can add:
  - Audio picker and element creation using a similar pattern.
  - Drag/resize for timeline elements using dnd-kit (you already installed the packages).
  - Replace/duplicate/split actions wired into the store.
  - Media library for reusing previously added assets (persisted URLs or uploads).

If you want, I can proceed to add element drag/resize in the tracks using dnd-kit, or add an audio picker next.
