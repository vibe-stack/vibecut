Task: Fix the editing features on the video renderer clips.

Description:
 - On mobile touchscreens, moving (translating) the clips doesn't work properly. It is not moving the clips, but once it captures the focus, clicking anywhere on the whole app (including outside the canvas) it keeps moving the clip near that click. Clicks should only render in the canvas

 - The transforms are very, very slow. I assume something is causing a lot of rerenders of a complex react tree? Optimize it by splitting things into smaller components and files

 - Clips should always, by default, fit into the visible viewport. Large clips (e.g. videos) sometimes overflow the viewport when added 
 
 - The pivot point for resizing is the center of the clip, it should be top left (but center for rotations)

 - The circles are too small, double the size

 - Additionally allow users to resize the clip with pinch gestures

State Management:
 - During an operation (translate, rotate, scale), always work on a local copy for efficiency.
 - Only commit to the store if the user stops an operation (releasing fingers)


Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
