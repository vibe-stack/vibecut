Task: Add an additional media type for text. Currently the Editor only supports videos and images.

User Interactions:
 - Users can add text
 - Texts are considered to be clips just like images and video
 - The text can also be dragged on the timeline and additionally:
 - Users can trim and extend the visible duration of the text
 - Text is also rotatable/scaleable in the canvas
 - Add additional actions for text only to the actions area:
  * Change Text
  * Adjust (Font, Bold, Italic, Color)

Data Requirements: 
 - Make sure to integrate it properly into the store structure
 - The adjustments should be non destructive, users should be able to reset, change, remove them at any time
 - The adjustments are always only applied to that one text clip and nothing else

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
