Task: Add animations to text clips.

User Interactions:
 - Users can add animations to text from the controls on the bottom
 - It opens a drawer with different categories for animations (Basic, Tite, Daily, Life, Vlog, Retro, etc.)
 - Animations can range from simple fade in/out to sophisticated shaders
 - Animations are non destructive: They are applied as a processing step before rendering the text and can be removed at any time
 - Animations can have their own settings, which are shown by expanding the drawer with a settings area on the bottom for that animation

Notes:
- Do not hardcode animations in types. Just assume they have a key: "fade-in", "laser-cut", "golden-dust"
- Create a library that is able to receive the text geometry and returns a new component that "knows" how to animate that component. Make sure it is aware of the playback and doesn't animate/loop on pause.

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
